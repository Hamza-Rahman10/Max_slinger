# Max_slinger
(Game Dev second year)

Max Slinger is a fast-paced first-person shooter built using Godot 4.3 that challenges players against extraterrestrial monsters in a modular sci-fi universe.   The game, which mixes nimble mobility, hitscan shooting, and opponent pathfinding, offers an immersive fighting experience with stylised graphics and simple gameplay.

This game was built to expand on my previous year's game programming experience with Java script, which laid the groundwork for my future job as a game developer.

This idea and assistance came from a YouTube channel called LegionGames, where I followed each video guide to construct my own game.
